B2B oriented website.
Front-end and back-end is run on Meteor.js and MongoDB. Hosted on Esry bucket estatic. Meteor.js is hosted on AWS container and runs a docker with Meteor.js. 
Worked with Blaze (native langue for Meteor.js) as Blaze has segmentation folds and the server memory capacity.

Three aspects need work and Nimrod would like to get estimates on them to understand which to move ahead first:
1. Migrate the existing code from Blaze to React which will allow having a more stable system from the user's point of view. We need a specialist who also knows also Meteor.js not on React.
2. Some revamping of the actual structure in the dashboard will need to done: the functionality is good, but from the UX standpoint it needs optimizing.
3. Test the actual website and then introduce testing procedures (regression) on the far back-end written in Python. (Priority 3).

Website with the new landing page will be ready by end of this week. 
Far back-end system is done in Python. Done independently of Meteor.js.
Outsourced design of the landing page to a design studio. Behind the static page there is a dashboard for the users to create a requests and present the data in a certain structure. 
Search engine is written with heavier functionality: cashing, indexing (only part of the data is fetched from the server to be presented quickly and then the remaining data should be fetched).
